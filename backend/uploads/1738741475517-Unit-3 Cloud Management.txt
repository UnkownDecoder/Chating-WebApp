Cloud Service Model ​

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) ​

Characteristics: Scalable, flexible, GUI and API-based access ​
Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine ​


Platform as a Service (PaaS) ​

Characteristics: Supports multiple languages, auto-scale, integrates with web services ​
Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku ​


Software as a Service (SaaS) ​

Characteristics: Managed centrally, accessible over the internet, automatic updates ​
Examples: Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox ​



Network as a Service (NaaS) ​

Provides network infrastructure directly and securely ​
Uses virtualized network infrastructure ​

Database as a Service (DBaaS) ​

Provides access to a database without physical setup ​
Examples: Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, MongoDB Atlas ​

Here are the important notes from the document:


Security Boundaries in Cloud Computing: ​

Data should be stored in encrypted form. ​
Use proxy and brokerage services to restrict direct access to shared data. ​
Analyze resource sensitivity to risk before moving to the cloud. ​
Understand responsibilities in different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). ​
Consider the type of cloud (public, private, community, hybrid). ​
Understand the cloud service provider's data storage and transfer systems. ​



Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Model: ​

Defines boundaries between service models and responsibilities. ​
IaaS provides infrastructure, PaaS provides platform development, and SaaS provides the operating environment. ​
Security concerns and capabilities are inherited upwards from IaaS to SaaS. ​
Customers are responsible for security below the defined boundary. ​



Cloud Operations and Management: ​

Cloud operations allow performing business operations over the Internet. ​
Use the right tools and resources, standardize and automate processes, and maintain service quality. ​
Efficient processes eliminate waste and redundancy. ​



Cloud Applications: ​

Business Applications: MailChimp, Chatter, Google Apps for Business, Quickbooks. ​
Data Storage and Backup Applications: Box.com, Mozy, Joukuu.
Education Applications: Google Apps for Education, Chromebooks for Education, Tablets with Google Play for Education, AWS in Education.
Entertainment Applications: Online games (Shaow, GeForce Now, Vortex, Project xCloud, PlayStation Now), Video conferencing apps. ​
Management Applications: Toggl, Evernote, Outright.
Social Applications: Facebook, Twitter. ​



These notes summarize the key points related to cloud security, operations, and various applications as discussed in the document. ​

Important Notes:


Big Data Concepts: ​

Big Data refers to datasets that are too large and complex for traditional data processing systems. ​
Characteristics include Volume, Velocity, and Variety. ​
Sources include social media, sensors, internet activity, and mobile devices. ​



Sources of Big Data: ​

Social Media: Activities on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. ​
Sensors: Data from temperature, humidity sensors, traffic cameras, security cameras. ​
Customer Feedback: Data from e-commerce sites, telecom companies. ​
E-commerce: Transaction data from online shopping, banking. ​
GPS: Data from vehicle movements. ​
IoT Appliances: Data from smart devices like TVs, washing machines. ​



Big Data vs. Traditional Database:

Big Data is generated outside the enterprise, has larger volumes, and includes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. ​
Traditional databases handle smaller, structured data volumes and are easier to manage.



Data Warehouse Concepts: ​

A Data Warehouse (DW) is a relational database designed for query and analysis, not transaction processing. ​
It provides integrated, historical data for decision-making. ​
Architecture includes Bottom Tier (Data Warehouse Server), Middle Tier (OLAP Server), and Top Tier (Front-end Tools). ​



Data Processing Techniques: ​

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Used for complex queries and multidimensional analysis. ​
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Used for executing multiple transactions simultaneously. ​



Data Lake Concepts: ​

A Data Lake is a centralized repository for storing structured and unstructured data. ​
It supports real-time analytics, machine learning, and does not require a predefined schema. ​
Architecture includes Source Layer, Data Processing Layer, and Target Layer. ​



Data Lake vs. Data Warehouse: ​

Data Lakes store raw, unstructured data and support schema-on-read. ​
Data Warehouses store structured data and use schema-on-write.
Data Lakes are more scalable and cost-efficient, while Data Warehouses offer high performance for structured queries.



These notes provide a concise overview of the key concepts and differences related to Big Data, Data Warehouses, and Data Lakes.
